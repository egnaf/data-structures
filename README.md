## Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

| ... | Access | Search | Insert | Delete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average | Θ(1) |	Θ(n) |	Θ(n) |	Θ(n) |
| Worst |	Θ(1) |	Θ(n) |	Θ(n) |	Θ(n) |

## Stack
In computer science, a **stack** is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
- **push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
- **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
